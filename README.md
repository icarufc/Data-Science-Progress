# Data Science Progress
 Here i'll be updating my Data Science progress. Since learning R, improving Python, using the pandas, numpy, seaborn, statistics until developing something with the use of DataBases etc.
 BUT, on this repository, there's only jupyter notebook files, but, they all have one language (obviously), Python or R, so, the files apart will be released soon.
